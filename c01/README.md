## Exercise 1.1

> Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from page 2.

#### Mac

	$ g++ -o exe1_1 ex1_1.cpp

## Exercise 1.2

> Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.

#### Mac

	$ ./ex1_1
	$ echo $?
	255

## Exercise 1.3

> Write a program to print _Hello, World_ on the standard output.

#### Mac

	$ g++ -o exe1_3 ex1_3.cpp
	$ ./ex1_3
	Hello, World
