## Exercise 2.1

> What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

- The language guarantees that `int` will be at least as large as `short` (16 bits), `long` at least 32 bits, `long long` at least 64 bits.

- A `signed` type represents negative or positive numbers(including zero); An `unsigned` type represents only value greater than or equal to zero.

- Typically, `float` is prepresented in one word(32 bits), `double` in two words(64 bits), and `long doubles` in either three or four words(96 or 128 bits)

__Deciding which type to use__

- Use an unsigned type when you know that the values cannot be negative.
- Use `int` for integer arithmetic. `short` is usually too small and, in practice, `long` often has the same size as `int`. If your data values are larger than the minimum guaranteed size of an `int`, then use `long long`.
- Do not use plain `char` or `bool` in arithmetic expressions. Use them _only_ to hold characters or truth values.
- Use `double` for floating-point computations; `float` usually does not have enough precision, and the cost of double-precision calculations versus single-precision is negligible.

## Exercise 2.2

> To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

use `double`

## Exercise 2.3 

> What output will the following code produce?
```cpp
unsigned u = 10, u2 = 42;
std::cout << u2 - u << std::endl;
std::cout << u - u2 << std::endl;
int i = 10, i2 = 42;
std::cout << i2 - i << std::endl;
std::cout << i - i2 << std::endl;
std::cout << i - u << std::endl;
std::cout << u - i << std::endl;
```

- (a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
- (b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC
- (c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L

(b) decimal, unsigned decimal, long decimal, unsigned long decimal, octal, hexadecimal
(c) double, float, long double
(d) decimal, unsigned decimal, double, double

int month = 09, day = 07;
```

## Exercise 2.7

## Exercise 2.8

> Using escape sequences, write a program to print 2M followed by a newline. Modify the program to print 2, then a tab, then an M, followed by a newline.

## Exercise 2.9

> Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.
- (a) std::cin >> int input_value;
- (b) int i = { 3.14 };
- (c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
- (d) int i = 3.14;

(a): error
(b): error
(c): error, wage is not defined
(d): correct but will be truncated

## Exercise 2.10

> What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?
```cpp
std::string global_str;
int global_int;
int main()
{
    int local_int;
    std::string local_str;
}
```	

Uninitialized objects of built-in type defined inside a function body have a undefined value. Objects of class type that we do not explicitly inititalize have a value that is defined by class.

## Exercise 2.11

> Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or a definition:
- (a) extern int ix = 1024;
- (b) int iy;
- (c) extern int iz;

(a): definition
(b): definition
(c): declaration

## Exercise 2.12

> Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?
- (a) int double = 3.14;
- (b) int _;
- (c) int catch-22;
- (d) int 1_or_2 = 1;
- (e) double Double = 3.14;

(a), (c), (d)

## Exercise 2.13

> What is the value of j in the following program?
```cpp
int i = 42;
int main()
{
	int i = 100;
	int j = i;
}
```

100

## Exercise 2.14

> Is the following program legal? If so, what values are printed?
```cpp
int i = 100, sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
    sum += i;
std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;
```

100 45

## Exercise 2.15

> Which of the following definitions, if any, are invalid? Why?
- (a) int ival = 1.01;
- (b) int &rval1 = 1.01;
- (c) int &rval2 = ival;
- (d) int &rval3;

(b) initializer must be an object
(d) a reference must be initialized

## Exercise 2.16

> Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are valid, explain what they do.
```cpp
int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;
```
- (a) r2 = 3.14159;
- (b) r2 = r1;
- (c) i = r2;
- (d) r1 = d;

(a) assign d 3.14159
(b) i will convert to double
(c) truncated
(d) truncated

## Exercise 2.17

> What does the following code print?
```cpp
int i, &ri = i;
i = 5; ri = 10;
std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl;
```

10 10

## Exercise 2.18

> Write code to change the value of a pointer. Write code to change the value to which the pointer points.

```cpp
int a = 1, b = 2;
int *p1 = &a, *p2 = p1;
p1 = &b;
*p1 = 3;
```

## Exercise 2.19

> Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

A __reference__ defines an alternative name for an object

A __pointer__ is a compound type that 'points to' another type.

#### Differences

- a reference is another name of an already existing object. a pointer is an object in its own right
- Once initialized, a reference remains bound to its initial object. A pointer can be assigned and copied.
- A reference must be initialized. A pointer need not be initialized at the time it is defined.

## Exercise 2.20

> What does the following program do?
```cpp
int i = 42;
int *p1 = &i;
*p1 = *p1 * * p1;
```

p1 = 42 * 42 = 1764

## Exercise 2.21

> Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether any are illegal and, if so, why.
```cpp
int i = 0;
```
(a) double * dp = &i;
(b) int *ip = i;
(c) int *p = &i;

(a) type error
(b) i is not address

## Exercise 2.22

> Assuming p is a pointer to int, explain the following code:
```cpp
if (p) // ...
if (*p) // ...
```

First one check whether p == nullptr
Second one check the value of p points to whether is 0

## Exercise 2.23

> Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a valid object? If so, how? If not, why not?

No, A pointer need not be initialized at the time it is defined. More info need to be provided.

## Exercise 2.24

> Why is the initialization of p legal but that of lp illegal?
```cpp
int i = 42;
void *p = &i;
long *lp = &i;
```

C++ forbids implicit conversions like `long *lp = &i;` but `void*` is a special pointer that may point to any type 

## Exercise 2.25

> Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.
- (a) ```cpp int* ip, i, &r = i; ```
- (b) ```cpp int i, *ip = 0; ```
- (c) ```cpp int* ip, ip2; ```

(a) ip is a pointer of int, i is an int, r is a reference of i
(b) i is an int, ip is `nullptr`
(c) ip is a pointer of int, ip2 is an int

## Exercise 2.26

> Which of the following are legal? For those that are illegal, explain why.
- (a) const int buf;
- (b) int cnt = 0;
- (c) const int sz = cnt;
- (d) ++cnt; ++sz;

(a) not initialized
(d) sz is const
