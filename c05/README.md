## Exercise 5.1

> What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?

A null statement is a single semicolon, which is also known as an empty statement.

A null statement is useful where the language requires a statement but the program's logic does not.

## Exercise 5.2

> What is a block? When might you might use a block?

A compound statement, usually referred to as a __block__, is a (possibly empty) sequence of statements and declarations surrounded by a pair of curly braces.

Compound statements are used when the language requires a single statement but the logic of our program needs more than one.

## Exercise 5.3

> Use the comma operator (ยง 4.10, p. 157) to rewrite the while loop from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 11) so that it no longer requires a block. Explain whether this rewrite improves or diminishes the readability of this code.

[code](ex5_3.cpp)

diminishes the readability.

## Exercise 5.4

> Explain each of the following examples, and correct any problems you detect.
```cpp
(a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) { /* ... */ }
(b) while (bool status = find(word)) { /* ... */ }
if (!status) { /* ... */ }
```

(a) 
```cpp
string::iterator iter = s.begin();
while (iter != s.end()) { /* ... */ }
```

(b) `status` is only declared inside the scope of `while` statement.

## Exercise 5.5

> Using an `if-else` statement, write your own version of the program to generate the letter grade from a numeric grade.

[code](ex5_5.cpp)

## Exercise 5.6

> Rewrite your grading program to use the conditional operator(ยง4.7, p.151) in place of the `if-else` statement.

[code](ex5_6.cpp)

## Exercise 5.7

> Correct the errors in each of the following code fragments:
```cpp
(a) if (ival1 != ival2) ival1 = ival2
    else ival1 = ival2 = 0;
(b) if (ival < minval) minval = ival;
    occurs = 1;
(c) if (int ival = get_value())
    cout << "ival = " << ival << endl;
    if (!ival)
    cout << "ival = 0\n";
(d) if (ival = 0)
    ival = get_value();
```

(a) `ival1 = ival2;`

(b) correct, but might intend to have large scope for both statement

(c) second `if` should be `else if`

(d) `ival == 0`

## Exercise 5.8

> What is a "dangling `else`"? How are `else` clauses resolved in C++?

How do we know to which `if` a given `else` belongs? This problem usually referred to __dangling `else`__

In C++ the ambiguity is resolved by specifying that each `else` is matched with the closest preceding unmatched `if`
