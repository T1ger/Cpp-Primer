## Exercise 10.1

> The `algorithm` header defines a function named `count` that, like `find`, takes a pair of iterators and a value. `count` returns a count of how often that value appears. Read a sequence of `int`s into a `vector` and print the `count` of how many elements have a given value.

## Exercise 10.2

> Repeat the previous program, but read values into a `list` of `string`s.
