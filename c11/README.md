## Exercise 11.1

> Describe the differences between a map and a vector.

`map` is an associative container, `vector` is a sequential container.

## Exercise 11.2

> Give an example of when each of list, vector, deque, map, and set might be most useful.

`list`: double-linked list

`vector`: dynamic array

`deque`: refer to [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3880254/why-do-we-need-deque-data-structures-in-the-real-world)

`map`: dictionary

`set`: to keep elements sorted and unique

## Exercise 11.3

> Write your own version of the word-counting program.

## Exercise 11.4

> Extend your program to ignore case and punctuation. For example, “example.” “example,” and “Example” should all increment the same counter.

[code](ex11_4.cpp)

## Exercise 11.5

> Explain the difference between a map and a set. When might you use one or the other?

## Exercise 11.7

> Define a `map` for which the key is the family’s last name and the value is a `vector` of the children’s names. Write code to add new families and to add new children to an existing family.

[code](ex11_7.cpp)

## Exercise 11.8

> Write a program that stores the excluded words in a `vector` instead of in a `set`. What are the advantages to using a `set`?
